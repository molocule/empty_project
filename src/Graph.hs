-- ColoringAlgorithm(G, ∆): A meta-algorithm for finding a (∆+1)-coloring in a graph G(V, E) with
-- maximum degree ∆.
-- 1. Sample Θ(log n) colors L(v) uniformly at random for each vertex v ∈ V (as in Theorem 1).
-- 2. Define, for each color c ∈ [∆ + 1], a set χc ⊆ V where v ∈ χc iff c ∈ L(v).
-- 3. Define Econflict as the set of all edges (u, v) where both u, v ∈ χc for some c ∈ [∆ + 1].
-- 4. Construct the conflict graph Gconflict(V, Econflict).
-- 5. Find a proper list-coloring of Gconflict(V, Econflict) with L(v) being the color list of vertex v ∈

-- sample \Theta(log n) colors L(v) uniformly at random
